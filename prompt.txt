Help me with my workflow in downloading articles. I use the portal through UIC to find an article. I then click on the "Find it at UIC" button, and then I download the pdf with a specific name such as Human Reprod Open 2025 De Jonge Global status male fert 38699533.pdf. The name always starts with the PubMed abbreviation of the journal followed by the year followed by an author followed by my short reference followed by the PubMed ID. The problem I have is that by the time I hit the save button for the pdf, I've forgotten half of that, and I spend time going back and filling it in. What I'd like is to be able to save the article with all of that filled in except the author which would be the first author by default but that I could change and with a short reference that I would fill in. Any ideas?
